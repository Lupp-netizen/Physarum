excerpt: "On the question of what to do — navigating between will-to-power and enlightenment toward a terminal value that might actually be right."

I want to understand reality. But — why? This is not a terminal goal, understanding feels essentially instrumental. Perhaps I should first solve philosophy — but what is philosophy? — it seems like merely creating and shuffling artificial categories (hmm yea "noumenal", "phenomenal"!) — maybe the Buddhists were more right — to truly understand reality is a non-cognitive endeavour. But I want both — cognitive and noumenal (so: philosophy and some Buddhism?).

So what is it that I want? Hard to say — easier question: what is actually going on, in terms of kinetics? Clearly there are many agenty entities, interfering with each other. One of them is me — so by investigating this agenty thing I may figure out what to do.

But — there is so much interference. War — game theory — is more fundamental than anything, things are out there, out to get you. But why should I care? Perhaps the agenty things are just silly attractor states. Perhaps almost everything is — attractors skewing the trajectory of an object. But what's the trajectory? Nietzsche would say will to power, probably. And so things like Christianity or more generally prosocial tendencies are attractors out there to get you. But what if Will to Power is too? Then it seems like enlightenment is the "natural trajectory" — this is not a great name for the thing — I mean the trajectory that one doesn't want to be interfered with, one that should unfold.

Okay, so it seems like there are two main contenders for the Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything:

- **Will to power** (eating the world — ceasing to be controlled by external forces)
- **Enlightenment** (accepting the world — ceasing to be controlled by internal forces)

Now one can just weigh them against each other, to find out one's True Trajectory, and thus the answer to What To Do.

Okay, eating the world feels a bit "undead" — I don't want to end up controlling the world and finding nothing but emptiness inside my psycho head. Not the answer. Enlightenment — sounds too good to be true, the Kenshō post is scary — it also seems undead (losing all life-force? Doesn't seem very alive to me). Hmm, maybe what I want is adventures! But really, just any adventures, forever? No — they have to have some meaning — ultimately, they have to move the chess pieces on the board of the world, to actually do something — to, to some extent, eat the world. So perhaps: get a little enlightened, and then eat the world to some extent?

I used the words "alive" and "undead" a lot now, but this is not what I want to point at. Rather, I want to point at "unfolding" — letting potentials become new particulars. This unfolding resonates the most, as a terminal goal. Things exist, and have some kinetics to them — my mind is undeniably one of them. Just as it is evil to prevent a butterfly from leaving its cocoon, it is evil to "interfere" — to hinder the unfoldings of things.

**Maximum unfolding** — and slowly, aesthetically, that's what seems to be the answer.

Maximum unfolding is not Nietzschean — it involves unfolding of non-self entities too, it must be altruistic to be maximised.
