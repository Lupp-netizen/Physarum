tldr: "Depression is an adaptive response to perceived failure: elevated acetylcholine increases sensitivity to prediction errors, enabling intense re-evaluation, but this creates a self-reinforcing attractor of pessimism, withdrawal, and rumination. The depressed state becomes hard to escape because the brain, aiming to minimize prediction error, filters and discounts positive data to confirm negative self-beliefs. Rationalists, already primed for high learning rates and error-sensitivity, may be especially vulnerable to this overfitting dynamic."
